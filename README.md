# Blind Motion DeblurGAN
Eliminating blur caused by motion given only the blurry image has been a challenging problem in computer vision. In this project, we reproduce DeblurGAN based on pix2pix by modifying the network architecture and loss function. After training on various datasets, our model achieve the performance provided by DeblurGAN quantitatively in the structural similarity measure (PSNR) as expected. 

We also experiment integrating traditional deblurring method with DeblurGAN, and obtain an artifact-elimination generative network. Besides, we introduce a post-processing method on images generated by DeblurGAN which outperforms the state-of-the-art blind deblurring algorithms.

## CycleGAN and pix2pix in PyTorch

We provide PyTorch implementations for both unpaired and paired image-to-image translation.

The code was written by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://github.com/junyanz) and [Taesung Park](https://github.com/taesung), and supported by [Tongzhou Wang](https://ssnl.github.io/).

This PyTorch implementation produces results comparable to or better than our original Torch software. If you would like to reproduce the same results as in the papers, check out the original [CycleGAN Torch](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) and [pix2pix Torch](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) code

**Note**: The current software works well with PyTorch 0.4+. Check out the older [branch](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/tree/pytorch0.3.1) that supports PyTorch 0.1-0.3.

You may find useful information in [training/test tips](docs/tips.md) and [frequently asked questions](docs/qa.md). To implement custom models and datasets, check out our [templates](#custom-model-and-dataset). To help users better understand and adapt our codebase, we provide an [overview](docs/overview.md) of the code structure of this repository.

## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Getting Started
### Installation

- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
cd pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
```

- Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org and) 0.4+ and other dependencies (e.g., torchvision, [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) and [dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate)).
  - For pip users, please type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - For Conda users, we provide a installation script `./scripts/conda_deps.sh`. Alternatively, you can create a new Conda environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
  - For Docker users, we provide the pre-built Docker image and Dockerfile. Please refer to our [Docker](docs/docker.md) page.

### CycleGAN train/test
- Download a CycleGAN dataset (e.g. maps):
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_cyclegan_dataset.sh maps
```
- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097.
- Train a model:
```bash
#!./scripts/train_cyclegan.sh
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan
```
To see more intermediate results, check out `./checkpoints/maps_cyclegan/web/index.html`.
- Test the model:
```bash
#!./scripts/test_cyclegan.sh
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan
```
- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/maps_cyclegan/latest_test/index.html`.

### pix2pix train/test
- Download a pix2pix dataset (e.g.facades):
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
```
- Train a model:
```bash
#!./scripts/train_pix2pix.sh
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
```
- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097. To see more intermediate results, check out  `./checkpoints/facades_pix2pix/web/index.html`.

- Test the model (`bash ./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh`):
```bash
#!./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
```
- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/facades_pix2pix/test_latest/index.html`. You can find more scripts at `scripts` directory.
- To train and test pix2pix-based colorization models, please add `--model colorization` and `--dataset_mode colorization`. See our training [tips](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/docs/tips.md#notes-on-colorization) for more details.

### Apply a pre-trained model (CycleGAN)
- You can download a pretrained model (e.g. horse2zebra) with the following script:
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_cyclegan_model.sh horse2zebra
```
- The pretrained model is saved at `./checkpoints/{name}_pretrained/latest_net_G.pth`. Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_cyclegan_model.sh#L3) for all the available CycleGAN models.
- To test the model, you also need to download the  horse2zebra dataset:
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_cyclegan_dataset.sh horse2zebra
```

- Then generate the results using
```bash
python test.py --dataroot datasets/horse2zebra/testA --name horse2zebra_pretrained --model test --no_dropout
```
- The option `--model test` is used for generating results of CycleGAN only for one side. This option will automatically set `--dataset_mode single`, which only loads the images from one set. On the contrary, using `--model cycle_gan` requires loading and generating results in both directions, which is sometimes unnecessary. The results will be saved at `./results/`. Use `--results_dir {directory_path_to_save_result}` to specify the results directory.

- For your own experiments, you might want to specify `--netG`, `--norm`, `--no_dropout` to match the generator architecture of the trained model.

### Apply a pre-trained model (pix2pix)
Download a pre-trained model with `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`.

- Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh#L3) for all the available pix2pix models. For example, if you would like to download label2photo model on the Facades dataset,
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh facades_label2photo
```
- Download the pix2pix facades datasets:
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
```
- Then generate the results using
```bash
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades/ --direction BtoA --model pix2pix --name facades_label2photo_pretrained
```
- Note that we specified `--direction BtoA` as Facades dataset's A to B direction is photos to labels.

- If you would like to apply a pre-trained model to a collection of input images (rather than image pairs), please use `--model test` option. See `./scripts/test_single.sh` for how to apply a model to Facade label maps (stored in the directory `facades/testB`).

- See a list of currently available models at `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`
